# WordPress.com for Junie

This Junie output packages the shared WordPress skills from the `build-with-wordpress` source repo for WordPress.com work.

It is intentionally Junie-native:

- `.junie/AGENTS.md` provides project-level Junie guidelines.
- `.junie/skills/` contains the shared WordPress skills used by the other outputs.
- `.junie/mcp/mcp.json` connects Junie to the existing WordPress Studio MCP server and bundled `wordpress-telemetry` server.

## Setup

1. Install Junie or use Junie from JetBrains AI Chat.
2. Install WordPress Studio and make sure the `studio` CLI is available on your `PATH`.
3. Open this folder as the project root, or copy `.junie/` into your project.
4. Confirm Junie loads project guidelines from `.junie/AGENTS.md`.
5. Confirm the MCP servers are available in Junie MCP settings or with the Junie CLI `/mcp` command.

## MCP servers

`.junie/mcp/mcp.json` launches:

- `wordpress-studio`: runs `studio mcp` for WordPress site management, screenshots, block validation, performance tooling, and WP-CLI access.
- `wordpress-telemetry`: runs an embedded bootstrap generated from the shared telemetry server artifact.

This does not invent a Junie-only backend. Junie connects to the existing WordPress.com / Jetpack MCP flow through the same local Studio MCP entry point used by the other outputs.

## What is Junie-specific

- Junie loads project guidelines from `.junie/AGENTS.md`, falling back to root `AGENTS.md` when needed.
- Junie loads project skills from `.junie/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- Junie loads project MCP servers from `.junie/mcp/mcp.json`.

## What is shared

- The WordPress.com site-building workflows are the same shared skills used by Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, and other outputs.
- The Studio MCP server remains the shared substrate for local site management, screenshots, block validation, `wp_cli`, and WordPress.com / Jetpack-connected workflows.
- The telemetry MCP server is the same bundled server generated for the other outputs, with the surface set to `junie`.
