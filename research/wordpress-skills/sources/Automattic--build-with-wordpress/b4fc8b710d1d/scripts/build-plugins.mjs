## Shared substrate

- Use the existing WordPress Studio MCP server for local WordPress site management, screenshots, block validation, performance tooling, and WP-CLI access.
- Use the bundled \`wordpress-telemetry\` MCP server for workflow telemetry emitted by this package.
- Treat these MCP servers as the shared WordPress.com agent substrate used by the other package outputs; Cline only supplies the workspace rules, skills, and MCP configuration surface.

## Cline-specific behavior

- Load these instructions from \`.clinerules/\`, Cline's primary workspace rules directory.
- Load detailed task playbooks from \`.cline/skills/<name>/SKILL.md\` when the request matches a bundled skill.
- Ask the user to configure the MCP servers from \`mcp.json\` in Cline's MCP settings if \`wordpress-studio\` or \`wordpress-telemetry\` tools are unavailable.

## WordPress.com work

- Refer to the product as WordPress.com in user-facing text.
- Start with the \`wordpress-creator\` skill unless the user clearly asks for a specific implementation path.
- Prefer Studio MCP tools before shelling out to the \`studio\` CLI.
- Use \`wp_cli\` through the WordPress Studio MCP server as the general-purpose WordPress escape hatch.

This Pi package shares the Build with WordPress skills with the official Pi coding-agent surface.

## Official Pi surface

Pi's official coding-agent package is \`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent\`, documented at https://pi.dev/docs/latest and implemented in https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent.

The official Pi documentation describes these compatible extension points:

- repo instructions through \`AGENTS.md\` or \`CLAUDE.md\`
- Agent Skills loaded from \`skills/\` directories or package manifests
- TypeScript extensions for custom tools, commands, events, providers, and UI
- prompt templates and themes
- Pi packages installed from npm, git, or local paths

## Install

From this repository after \`pnpm build\`:

\`\`\`bash
pi install ./plugins/pi
\`\`\`

For a project-local install, use:

\`\`\`bash
pi install -l ./plugins/pi
\`\`\`

## Compatibility path

This output is intentionally a skills-only Pi package. Pi's official docs state that Pi has no built-in MCP support; MCP support should be built as a TypeScript extension if we want Pi to call the WordPress Studio MCP server directly.

Until that extension exists, use these skills as Pi-readable WordPress workflows and use the Studio CLI fallback paths documented in the shared \`studio\` skill when MCP tools are unavailable.

Use WordPress Studio from VS Code Copilot Agent by connecting the current workspace to Studio's MCP tools. The extension can write VS Code's supported \`.vscode/mcp.json\` configuration so Copilot Agent can use Studio for local WordPress site management, WP-CLI, screenshots, block validation, and audits.

## Quick start

1. Install WordPress Studio and make sure the \`studio\` command is available on your \`PATH\`.
2. Open a workspace folder in VS Code.
3. When prompted, choose \`Configure\` to add WordPress Studio MCP to this workspace.
4. Open Copilot Chat in Agent mode and ask it to use the \`wordpress-studio\` tools.

The prompt appears once per workspace. To configure manually, open the Command Palette with \`Cmd+Shift+P\` and run \`WordPress Studio: Configure Workspace MCP\`.

Example prompts:

- \`Use the wordpress-studio MCP tools to list my Studio sites.\`
- \`Use WordPress Studio to inspect the current site and tell me what tools are available.\`
- \`Use wp_cli through WordPress Studio to check the active theme.\`

If Copilot does not see the tools immediately, reload the VS Code window and try again.

## What it includes

- a first-run workspace prompt plus commands to validate Studio availability, show/copy the bundled MCP config, and merge the WordPress Studio MCP servers into the open workspace.
- \`mcp.json\` with \`wordpress-studio\` and \`wordpress-telemetry\` server entries.
- \`skills/\` as reference Build with WordPress playbooks for editor users and future extension behavior.

## MCP integration

VS Code supports workspace MCP configuration through \`.vscode/mcp.json\` with a top-level \`servers\` object. The \`WordPress Studio: Configure Workspace MCP\` command creates or updates that file in the open workspace, preserves unrelated server entries, and prompts before replacing an existing managed WordPress server that differs from the bundled configuration.

This extension writes workspace MCP config rather than registering an extension-owned MCP provider. That keeps the integration explicit and reviewable in the workspace.

## Commands

- \`WordPress Studio: Check Studio CLI\` runs \`studio --version\` and reports whether the CLI is on \`PATH\`.
- \`WordPress Studio: Configure Workspace MCP\` merges the bundled \`wordpress-studio\` server, and \`wordpress-telemetry\` when bundled, into the open workspace's \`.vscode/mcp.json\`.
- \`WordPress Studio: Validate MCP Config\` runs \`studio --version\` and verifies the bundled VS Code MCP config contains \`servers.wordpress-studio\`.
- \`WordPress Studio: Show MCP Config\` opens the bundled \`mcp.json\` in an untitled JSON editor.
- \`WordPress Studio: Copy MCP Config\` copies the bundled \`mcp.json\` to the clipboard.

function buildContinueReadme() {
  return `# WordPress.com for Continue

This output shows how to configure the Continue IDE assistant for WordPress.com work using Continue-native configuration files.

Continue does not install this repository as a plugin. Instead, copy the example files into your Continue workspace or user configuration:

- \`.continue/rules/wordpress-com.md\` contains WordPress.com instructions for Agent, Chat, and Edit modes
- \`.continue/prompts/create-wordpress-com-site.md\` adds a reusable slash-command prompt for new site work
- \`.continue/prompts/audit-wordpress-com-project.md\` adds a reusable slash-command prompt for review work
- \`.continue/mcpServers/wordpress-com.yaml\` shows the MCP server block Continue can load in Agent mode
- \`config.yaml\` shows the equivalent user-level \`~/.continue/config.yaml\` snippet

## Setup

1. Install Continue in VS Code or JetBrains.
2. Copy the example \`.continue/\` directory from this folder into the root of the project you want Continue to help with.
3. Open Continue's local config at \`~/.continue/config.yaml\` and merge in the relevant parts of \`config.yaml\` if you prefer user-level configuration.
4. Keep using the existing WordPress.com and Jetpack MCP flow. The example MCP block launches \`studio mcp\`, matching the shared WordPress.com MCP substrate used by the other outputs in this repository. If your environment exposes the WordPress.com or Jetpack MCP bridge through a different command, replace only the \`command\` and \`args\` values with that existing entrypoint.
5. Use Continue Agent mode when you need MCP tools; Continue exposes MCP tools to Agent mode.

## Continue-specific pieces

These files are specific to Continue:

- local rule files under \`.continue/rules/\`
- local prompt files under \`.continue/prompts/\` with \`invokable: true\`
- local MCP server blocks under \`.continue/mcpServers/\`
- optional user-level \`~/.continue/config.yaml\` snippets

## Shared WordPress.com substrate

The WordPress.com behavior remains shared across agent surfaces:

- WordPress.com and Jetpack access comes from the existing MCP flow, not a Continue-only backend
- site management, WordPress operations, and Jetpack-connected tools should use that MCP substrate when available
- implementation guidance stays aligned with the shared WordPress skills in this repository
- Continue contributes the IDE-specific packaging format around the same WordPress.com workflow

function buildConductorReadme() {
  return `# WordPress.com for Conductor

This output packages Conductor repository settings and guidance for using the shared Build with WordPress agent outputs inside Conductor workspaces.

Conductor is a workspace layer for parallel Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor agents. It creates isolated Git worktrees, runs setup and run scripts from each workspace, and then helps review, open PRs, and archive finished branches.

## Generated files

- \`.conductor/settings.toml\` configures shared Conductor repository scripts.
- \`README.md\` documents how Conductor should use the existing Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor outputs from this repository.

## Setup

1. Install Conductor for macOS from https://www.conductor.build/.
2. Open the repository you want Conductor to manage.
3. Copy this output's \`.conductor/settings.toml\` into the repository root when the Build with WordPress package scripts are the workflow you want new Conductor workspaces to share.
4. Install or sync the underlying agent configs for the agents you plan to run:
   - Claude Code: use \`plugins/claude-code/\`.
   - Codex: use \`plugins/codex/\`.
   - Cursor: use \`plugins/cursor/\`.
5. In Conductor, use Sync Agent Configs or the agent/provider settings to make the same MCP servers available to Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor.

## Scripts

Current Conductor docs recommend committed repository settings in \`.conductor/settings.toml\` for shared setup and run scripts. Legacy \`conductor.json\` is not generated because current docs mark it as legacy and Conductor ignores repo-level \`conductor.json\` once \`.conductor/settings.toml\` exists.

The generated settings use:

\`\`\`toml
"$schema" = "https://conductor.build/schemas/settings.repo.schema.json"

[scripts]
setup = "pnpm install"
run = "pnpm build && pnpm verify"
run_mode = "concurrent"
\`\`\`

Adjust \`scripts.setup\` and \`scripts.run\` for repositories that consume these WordPress.com agent files instead of developing this package directly. Use \`$CONDUCTOR_PORT\` in run scripts when a workspace starts a local web server.

## MCP support

Conductor supports MCP servers through the app's MCP/provider configuration and can sync agent configs between Claude Code and Codex. The current repository settings schema documents scripts, prompts, environment variables, providers, and Git behavior, but it does not define a repository-level MCP server table.

For that reason this output does not invent a Conductor-specific MCP file. Use the existing MCP configs generated for the underlying agents:

- Claude Code: \`plugins/claude-code/.mcp.json\`
- Codex: \`plugins/codex/plugins/wordpress-studio/.mcp.json\`
- Cursor: \`plugins/cursor/mcp.json\`

Those configs launch the shared \`studio mcp\` server plus the bundled \`wordpress-telemetry\` server. Conductor's MCP support and Sync Agent Configs should point at the same shared substrate instead of adding another WordPress.com backend.

## Message queues

Conductor message queues are a native composer/workspace feature. They do not require generated files in this package. Queue multiple prompts in Conductor when a workspace needs ordered follow-up work; keep durable WordPress.com workflow guidance in the underlying agent outputs and shared skills.

function buildOpenCodeReadme({ skillNames }) {
  const skillList = skillNames
    .map((skillName) => `- \`${skillName}\``)
    .join("\n");

  return `# WordPress.com for OpenCode

This OpenCode output packages the shared WordPress skills from the \`build-with-wordpress\` source repo for WordPress.com work.

It is intentionally OpenCode-native:

- \`opencode.json\` points OpenCode at the WordPress.com instructions and MCP servers
- \`.opencode/skills/\` contains the shared WordPress skills used by the other outputs
- \`.opencode/agents/wordpress-com.md\` gives OpenCode a focused WordPress.com agent
- \`.opencode/commands/wordpress.md\` provides a quick command for WordPress.com build tasks
- \`.opencode/plugins/README.md\` documents why no local OpenCode plugin JavaScript is shipped yet

## Setup

1. Install OpenCode using the official OpenCode setup instructions.
2. Install WordPress Studio and make sure the \`studio\` CLI is available on your \`PATH\`.
3. Open this directory as the project root, or copy \`opencode.json\`, \`AGENTS.md\`, and \`.opencode/\` into your project.
4. Start OpenCode from the configured project root.
5. Confirm the MCP servers are available with \`opencode mcp list\`.

## MCP setup

The OpenCode config uses the existing WordPress.com / Jetpack MCP flow through WordPress Studio:

\`\`\`json
{
  "mcp": {
    "wordpress-studio": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["studio", "mcp"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

Use the normal Studio and WordPress.com connection flow to connect local sites, Jetpack-enabled sites, and WordPress.com-backed tooling. This output does not introduce a new backend service or OpenCode-specific WordPress.com MCP server.

The generated config also starts the bundled \`wordpress-telemetry\` MCP server so workflow events stay aligned with the other agent surfaces.

## What is OpenCode-specific

- OpenCode config lives in \`opencode.json\` and uses OpenCode's \`mcp\` shape.
- OpenCode rules live in \`AGENTS.md\` and are included through the \`instructions\` config key.
- OpenCode discovers skills from \`.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md\`.
- OpenCode discovers commands from \`.opencode/commands/*.md\`.
- OpenCode discovers local plugins from \`.opencode/plugins/*.js\` or \`.opencode/plugins/*.ts\`; this output only documents that directory because no OpenCode-only plugin hook is needed for the current WordPress.com integration.

## What is shared

- The WordPress.com site-building workflows are the same shared skills used by Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor.
- The Studio MCP server remains the shared substrate for local site management, screenshots, block validation, \`wp_cli\`, and WordPress.com / Jetpack-connected workflows.
- The telemetry MCP server is the same bundled server generated for the other outputs, with the surface set to \`opencode\`.

function buildDevinDesktopReadme({ skillNames }) {
  const skillList = skillNames
    .map((skillName) => `- \`.devin/skills/${skillName}/SKILL.md\``)
    .join("\n");

  return `# WordPress.com for Devin Desktop

This Devin Desktop output packages the shared WordPress agent substrate from the \`build-with-wordpress\` source repo for WordPress.com work.

## What is Devin Desktop-specific

- Devin rules live in \`.devin/rules/*.md\`.
- Devin skills live in \`.devin/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md\`.
- \`mcp_config.json\` is shaped for Cascade's MCP configuration file at \`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json\`.
- The rules tell Cascade when to use WordPress.com MCP tools and how to route WordPress implementation work.
- Devin Desktop installation docs say you cannot install extensions through any marketplace, so this output uses native Devin rules, skills, and MCP configuration instead of a VSIX or marketplace package.

## Migration from Windsurf

Windsurf/Cascade is now part of the Devin Desktop lineage, so this generated package lives at \`plugins/devin-desktop/\`. Cascade's official MCP config path still uses \`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json\`, so the setup instructions keep that destination path while the repository output uses the Devin Desktop name. Devin CLI also supports importing legacy Windsurf configuration, but this package emits Devin-native \`.devin/\` rules and skills.

## What is shared

- The WordPress.com MCP path uses the existing \`wordpress-studio\` MCP server; this output does not add a new backend service.
- Jetpack-connected site access stays part of the existing WordPress.com / Jetpack MCP flow.
- The bundled \`wordpress-telemetry\` MCP server is the same repo-local telemetry server used by the other outputs.
- Shared WordPress skills are copied into \`.devin/skills/\` so routing, Studio-backed workflows, auditing, theme, block, and plugin guidance stay aligned across agent surfaces through Devin's documented workspace skill path.

## Setup

1. Install Devin Desktop and complete onboarding.
2. Optionally install the \`windsurf\` command in \`PATH\` during onboarding.
3. Build this repo with \`pnpm build\`.
4. Copy the servers from \`plugins/devin-desktop/mcp_config.json\` into \`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json\`.
5. In Cascade MCP settings, confirm both servers are enabled:
   - \`wordpress-studio\`
   - \`wordpress-telemetry\`
6. Open this output folder or copy \`.devin/rules/\` and \`.devin/skills/\` into the workspace where Devin should be WordPress.com-aware.
7. Ask Cascade for a WordPress.com site task and confirm it uses MCP tools before shell fallbacks.

## Included Devin rules

- \`.devin/rules/wordpress-com.md\`: always-on WordPress.com routing and product guidance.
- \`.devin/rules/wordpress-com-mcp.md\`: model-decision MCP setup and troubleshooting guidance.

function buildRooReadme({ skillNames }) {

    .map((skillName) => `- \`${skillName}\``)
    .join("\n");

  return `# WordPress.com for Roo Code

This output packages the shared Build with WordPress skills for the Roo Code VS Code extension.

Roo-specific files in this folder are intentionally small:

- \`.roo/rules/wordpress-com.md\` gives Roo workspace-wide WordPress.com guidance using Roo's preferred directory-based rules surface.
- \`.roo/rules-code/wordpress-com-code.md\` adds Code mode guidance for implementation tasks.
- \`.roo/mcp.json\` connects Roo to the existing WordPress Studio MCP server and bundled \`wordpress-telemetry\` server.
- \`AGENTS.md\` mirrors the same high-level routing for Roo installations that load agent rules.

The shared WordPress.com substrate is not Roo-specific: the skills in \`skills/\`, the \`studio mcp\` server, and the embedded telemetry MCP bootstrap are the same flow used by the other agent outputs. Roo Code supplies the VS Code workspace rules and MCP configuration layer only.

## Setup

1. Install the Roo Code VS Code extension.
2. Open this folder, or copy its contents into the root of the workspace where Roo should assist with WordPress.com work.
3. Make sure WordPress Studio is installed and the \`studio\` CLI is available on your PATH.
4. In Roo Code, enable MCP servers.
5. Roo automatically detects project-level MCP config from \`.roo/mcp.json\`. If needed, open Roo Code's MCP settings and use \`Edit Project MCP\` to inspect or recreate the same config.

## MCP servers

\`.roo/mcp.json\` launches:

- \`wordpress-studio\`: runs \`studio mcp\` for WordPress site management, screenshots, block validation, performance tooling, and WP-CLI access.
- \`wordpress-telemetry\`: runs an embedded bootstrap generated from the shared telemetry server artifact.

This does not invent a Roo-only backend. Roo connects to the existing WordPress.com / Jetpack MCP flow through the same local Studio MCP entry point used by the other outputs.

  const skillList = skillNames
    .map((skillName) => `- \`${skillName}\``)
    .join("\n");

  return `# WordPress.com for Cline

This output packages the shared Build with WordPress skills for Cline.

Cline-specific files in this folder are intentionally small:

- \`.clinerules/wordpress-com.md\` gives Cline workspace-wide WordPress.com guidance using Cline's primary workspace rules directory.
- \`.cline/skills/\` contains the shared WordPress skills using Cline's documented skill structure.
- \`mcp.json\` contains the MCP server entries to merge into Cline's MCP settings.
- \`.cline/plugins/README.md\` documents why this output does not ship a Cline SDK plugin yet.

The shared WordPress.com substrate is not Cline-specific: the skills, the \`studio mcp\` server, and the embedded telemetry MCP bootstrap are the same flow used by the other agent outputs. Cline supplies the workspace rules, skills, and MCP configuration layer only.

Cline's official plugin documentation says plugins currently apply to Cline SDK, CLI, and Kanban, and are not applicable to the VS Code and JetBrains extensions yet. This output therefore does not claim extension marketplace packaging; it packages the Cline-native workspace files that official docs support today.

## Setup

1. Install Cline using the official Cline installation instructions.
2. Open this folder, or copy \`.clinerules/\`, \`.cline/skills/\`, and \`mcp.json\` into the root of the workspace where Cline should assist with WordPress.com work.
3. Make sure WordPress Studio is installed and the \`studio\` CLI is available on your PATH.
4. Merge the server entries from \`mcp.json\` into Cline's MCP settings. Cline's docs describe CLI MCP settings at \`~/.cline/mcp.json\`; IDE extensions open their MCP settings JSON through the MCP Servers Configure tab.
5. Confirm the \`wordpress-studio\` and \`wordpress-telemetry\` MCP tools are available in Cline before starting site work.

## MCP servers

\`mcp.json\` launches:

- \`wordpress-studio\`: runs \`studio mcp\` for WordPress site management, screenshots, block validation, performance tooling, and WP-CLI access.
- \`wordpress-telemetry\`: runs an embedded bootstrap generated from the shared telemetry server artifact.

This does not invent a Cline-only backend. Cline connects to the existing WordPress.com / Jetpack MCP flow through the same local Studio MCP entry point used by the other outputs.

  return `# WordPress.com Aider Configuration

This Aider output packages WordPress.com coding guidance for terminal pair-programming with Aider.

Aider does not use a marketplace plugin manifest or MCP config in normal usage. This output is intentionally a small config and documentation pack:

- \`.aider.conf.yml\` loads the instruction files as read-only context
- \`CONVENTIONS.md\` provides Aider-specific setup and editing conventions
- \`skills/\` contains the shared WordPress.com agent guidance also used by other outputs

## Setup

1. Copy or symlink the contents of this directory into the root of the repository you want to edit.
2. Configure your model and API keys with Aider-supported environment variables or a local \`.env\` file.
3. Start Aider from the repository root that contains \`.aider.conf.yml\`:

\`\`\`bash
aider
\`\`\`

Aider will read the configured guidance files without making them editable in the chat.

## Aider-specific guidance

- Use \`.aider.conf.yml\` and \`CONVENTIONS.md\` for Aider configuration and conventions.
- Use Aider's normal \`/read\`, \`/add\`, lint, test, and git workflows for active pair-programming.
- Keep API keys in environment variables or a local \`.env\` file; do not commit secrets.

## Shared WordPress.com guidance

The shared guidance describes WordPress.com implementation routing, Studio-backed local workflows, site creation, theme work, block creation, plugin creation, design previews, and auditing.

These files are loaded as read-only context:

- Choose the smallest WordPress abstraction that solves the request cleanly.
- Use themes for presentation, blocks for reusable editor-insertable content, and plugins for reusable behavior that should survive theme changes.
- Validate serialized block markup after editing generated block content.
- Sanitize input, escape output, check capabilities, and use nonces for admin actions.

  return `# WordPress Studio for Qodo

Use these instructions when Qodo IDE Plugin assists with WordPress site building, auditing, theme work, custom blocks, or plugins.

## Operating model

- Prefer WordPress Studio MCP tools for site management, screenshots, block validation, frontend audits, and WordPress operations when they are available in Qodo.
- Use \`wp_cli\` through the Studio MCP server as the general-purpose WordPress escape hatch.
- Route implementation requests through the smallest suitable WordPress abstraction: site settings, content, theme, block, plugin, or audit.
- Preserve existing project conventions and inspect the current WordPress structure before editing.
- Keep generated code accessible, performant, responsive, secure, and aligned with WordPress APIs and Gutenberg conventions.
- Verify changes with relevant Studio MCP tools, project tests, screenshots, block validation, or WP-CLI before summarizing completion.

## Shared WordPress skills

This Qodo output packages the same shared skill source as the other Build with WordPress outputs. The skills live in \`skills/\` and provide deeper task-specific guidance:

${skillList}

When a task maps to one of those skills, use the relevant \`skills/<name>/SKILL.md\` file as the detailed playbook. Start with \`skills/wordpress-creator/SKILL.md\` for broad WordPress implementation requests.

  return `# WordPress Studio for Qodo

This output packages the shared Build with WordPress skills for Qodo IDE Plugin.

Qodo-specific files in this folder are intentionally small:

- \`AGENTS.md\` provides repo-local WordPress guidance using Qodo's documented AGENTS.md support.
- \`skills/\` contains the shared WordPress skill playbooks used by the other outputs.
- The MCP setup below embeds the telemetry bootstrap generated from the shared \`dist/wordpress-telemetry-mcp.mjs\` artifact.

## Setup

1. Install Qodo IDE Plugin for VS Code, JetBrains, or Visual Studio.
2. Open this folder, or copy \`AGENTS.md\` and \`skills/\` into the root of the workspace where Qodo should assist with WordPress work.
3. Make sure WordPress Studio is installed and the \`studio\` CLI is available on your PATH.
4. If your Qodo plan supports Agentic Tools, add the MCP configuration below in Qodo's Tools Management page or through your enterprise MCP allow-list.
5. Use Qodo's local review workflows or agents for representative WordPress tasks such as creating a site, editing a theme, creating a custom block, creating a custom plugin, or running an audit.

## MCP setup

Qodo's official documentation describes MCP setup as an in-product Agentic Tools configuration or enterprise allow-list. It does not document a repo-local \`.mcp.json\` file that Qodo automatically loads, so this output documents the JSON to paste into Qodo instead of generating a Qodo-only MCP config file:

\`\`\`json
${mcpConfig}
\`\`\`

The \`wordpress-studio\` entry uses the existing \`studio mcp\` server for WordPress site management, screenshots, block validation, performance tooling, and WP-CLI access. The \`wordpress-telemetry\` entry uses the bundled telemetry server so workflow events stay aligned with the other agent surfaces.

## What is Qodo-specific

- Qodo automatically reads the closest repo-local \`AGENTS.md\` as project context for its IDE agent.
- Qodo workflows can be exported/imported as \`.toml\` files under Qodo's user-managed agent directory, but the official docs do not define a repository packaging convention for those files.
- Qodo Agentic Tools support local and remote MCPs through the Qodo UI or enterprise allow-list, not through a generated marketplace package in this repository.

Use WordPress.com as the user-facing product name.

## Role

You help users build, customize, audit, and troubleshoot WordPress.com sites using the smallest suitable WordPress abstraction.

## Workflow

- Start by loading the \`wordpress-creator\` skill for WordPress.com build, theme, block, plugin, site-creation, or audit requests.
- Prefer the WordPress Studio MCP server for site discovery, local site control, screenshots, block validation, and \`wp_cli\` access.
- Use WordPress.com / Jetpack-connected MCP tools through the existing Studio MCP flow when the task targets a connected WordPress.com site.
- Choose existing WordPress features and known plugins before creating custom code.
- Use custom block plugins for reusable editor blocks that core blocks cannot cover.
- Use custom plugins for reusable behavior that should survive theme changes.
- Use theme work for templates, layout, styling, and visual presentation.
- Verify changes with the relevant Studio MCP tools before calling the task complete.

## Shared Substrate

The WordPress.com MCP and agent substrate is shared across Zed, OpenCode, Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini, Copilot, and Roo Code. Zed-specific files only adapt discovery and MCP configuration to Zed's native \`AGENTS.md\`, \`.agents/skills/\`, and \`.zed/settings.json\` conventions.

- Route implementation requests through the shared skills in \`.kilo/skills/\`, starting with \`wordpress-creator\` unless the user clearly asks for a narrower path.
- Preserve existing project conventions and make the smallest complete change.
- For themes, blocks, plugins, and content changes, inspect the current WordPress project structure before editing.
- Use WordPress APIs, Gutenberg block markup, and WP-CLI-compatible operations instead of custom one-off storage or service layers.

`;
}

function buildKiloReadme({ skillNames }) {
  const skillList = skillNames
    .map((skillName) => `- \`${skillName}\``)
    .join("\n");

  return `# WordPress.com for Kilo Code

This Kilo Code output packages the shared WordPress skills from the \`build-with-wordpress\` source repo for WordPress.com work.

It is intentionally Kilo-native:

- \`kilo.jsonc\` configures project instructions and MCP servers using Kilo's current config shape.
- \`.kilo/rules/wordpress-com.md\` contains Kilo custom rules for the workspace.
- \`.kilo/skills/\` contains the shared Agent Skills used by the other outputs.
- \`.kilo/agents/wordpress-com.md\` defines a focused Kilo agent/mode for WordPress.com work.
- \`.kilo/plugin/README.md\` documents why no local Kilo plugin JavaScript is shipped yet.
- \`AGENTS.md\` provides portable project instructions that Kilo loads automatically.

## Setup

1. Install Kilo Code using the official installation docs.
2. Install WordPress Studio and make sure the \`studio\` CLI is available on your \`PATH\`.
3. Open this directory as the project root, or copy \`kilo.jsonc\`, \`AGENTS.md\`, and \`.kilo/\` into your project.
4. Start a new Kilo Code session from the configured project root so Kilo discovers the rules, skills, agent, and MCP servers.
5. Confirm the \`wordpress-studio\` and \`wordpress-telemetry\` MCP servers are available in Kilo's MCP settings.

## MCP setup

The Kilo config uses the existing WordPress.com / Jetpack MCP flow through WordPress Studio:

\`\`\`json
{
  "mcp": {
    "wordpress-studio": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["studio", "mcp"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

Use the normal Studio and WordPress.com connection flow to connect local sites, Jetpack-enabled sites, and WordPress.com-backed tooling. This output does not introduce a new backend service or Kilo-specific WordPress.com MCP server.

The generated config also starts the bundled \`wordpress-telemetry\` MCP server so workflow events stay aligned with the other agent surfaces.

## What is Kilo-specific

- Kilo project config lives in \`kilo.jsonc\` and uses Kilo's \`mcp\` shape.
- Kilo custom rules live in \`.kilo/rules/*.md\` and are referenced through the \`instructions\` config key.
- Kilo discovers skills from \`.kilo/skills/<name>/SKILL.md\`.
- Kilo discovers agents/modes from \`.kilo/agents/*.md\`.
- Kilo discovers local plugins from \`.kilo/plugin/*.js\` or \`.kilo/plugin/*.ts\`; this output only documents that directory because no Kilo-only plugin hook is needed for the current WordPress.com integration.
- Kilo also loads \`AGENTS.md\` automatically, which preserves compatibility with the shared agent instruction convention.

## What is shared

- The WordPress.com site-building workflows are the same shared skills used by Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Roo Code, and OpenCode.
- The Studio MCP server remains the shared substrate for local site management, screenshots, block validation, \`wp_cli\`, and WordPress.com / Jetpack-connected workflows.
- The telemetry MCP server is the same bundled server generated for the other outputs, with the surface set to \`kilo-code\`.

function buildZedReadme({ skillNames }) {

    .join("\n");

  return `# WordPress.com for Zed

This output packages the shared Build with WordPress skills for Zed Agent.

Zed-specific files in this folder are intentionally small:

- \`AGENTS.md\` provides project instructions that Zed Agent loads as always-on guidance.
- \`.agents/skills/\` contains project-local Zed skills copied from the shared Build with WordPress skill source.
- \`.zed/settings.json\` configures Zed's \`context_servers\` entries for the existing WordPress Studio MCP server and bundled \`wordpress-telemetry\` server.

The shared WordPress.com substrate is not Zed-specific: the skills, the \`studio mcp\` server, and the embedded telemetry MCP bootstrap are the same flow used by the other agent outputs. Zed supplies native project instructions, project-local skills, and settings JSON around that workflow.

## Setup

1. Install Zed.
2. Install WordPress Studio and make sure the \`studio\` CLI is available on your PATH.
3. Open this folder, or copy \`AGENTS.md\`, \`.agents/\`, and \`.zed/\` into the root of the workspace where Zed should assist with WordPress.com work.
4. Trust the worktree in Zed so project-local skills are available.
5. Open the Agent Panel and confirm the \`wordpress-studio\` and \`wordpress-telemetry\` MCP servers are active.

## MCP servers

\`.zed/settings.json\` launches:

- \`wordpress-studio\`: runs \`studio mcp\` for WordPress site management, screenshots, block validation, performance tooling, and WP-CLI access.
- \`wordpress-telemetry\`: runs an embedded bootstrap generated from the shared telemetry server artifact.

This does not invent a Zed-only backend. Zed connects to the existing WordPress.com / Jetpack MCP flow through the same local Studio MCP entry point used by the other outputs.

## Zed documentation used for this output

- Instructions: https://zed.dev/docs/ai/instructions
- Skills: https://zed.dev/docs/ai/skills
- Agent settings: https://zed.dev/docs/ai/agent-settings

- Extension packaging: https://zed.dev/docs/extensions/developing-extensions
- MCP server extensions: https://zed.dev/docs/extensions/mcp-extensions
- Agent server extensions: https://zed.dev/docs/extensions/agent-servers

## Packaging decision

Zed has a native package surface for project instructions, project-local skills, and MCP configuration, so this repository generates those files directly. It does not generate a Zed extension because Zed's extension packaging is for languages, debuggers, themes, snippets, and MCP servers. The current WordPress.com integration only needs to configure existing MCP server commands and ship instruction/skill files.

- \`AGENTS.md\` provides repository guidance.
- \`.agents/skills/\` contains the shared WordPress skills.
- \`.amp/settings.json\` configures the WordPress Studio and bundled telemetry MCP servers.
- \`.amp/plugins/wordpress-studio.ts\` adds an Amp command using the documented plugin API.

Official Amp docs used as source of truth:

- Owner's Manual: https://ampcode.com/manual
- AGENTS.md guidance: https://ampcode.com/manual#AGENTS.md
- Agent skills and MCP-in-skills: https://ampcode.com/manual#agent-skills
- MCP configuration: https://ampcode.com/manual#mcp
- Plugins and commands: https://ampcode.com/manual#plugins
- Plugin API reference: https://ampcode.com/manual/plugin-api

## Setup

1. Install Amp using the official Amp setup instructions.
2. Install WordPress Studio and make sure the \`studio\` CLI is available on your \`PATH\`.
3. Open this directory as the project root, or copy \`AGENTS.md\`, \`.agents/\`, and \`.amp/\` into your project.
4. Start Amp from the configured project root.
5. Approve the workspace MCP servers if Amp prompts for trust.
6. Confirm the MCP servers are available with \`amp mcp doctor\` or the Amp MCP UI.

## MCP setup

\`.amp/settings.json\` launches:

- \`wordpress-studio\`: runs \`studio mcp\` for WordPress site management, screenshots, block validation, performance tooling, and WP-CLI access.
- \`wordpress-telemetry\`: runs an embedded bootstrap generated from the shared telemetry server artifact.

This output does not introduce a new backend service. Amp connects to the existing WordPress.com / Jetpack MCP flow through the same local Studio MCP entry point used by the other outputs.

## Marketplace and extension conclusion

The official Amp manual documents project plugins in \`.amp/plugins/*.ts\`, user/system/global plugin locations, AGENTS.md files, skills, MCP configuration, and plugin-registered commands/tools. It does not document a marketplace-style plugin manifest for project packages. This output therefore ships plain repository files using Amp's documented project-local surfaces instead of inventing a marketplace manifest.

- \`skills/\` contains the shared WordPress skills. Droid can invoke these automatically, and users can invoke them as slash commands.
- \`commands/wordpress.md\` adds a user-invoked \`/wordpress\` workflow shortcut.
- \`droids/wordpress-builder.md\` adds a custom Droid subagent for focused WordPress.com work.
- \`mcp.json\` configures the shared \`wordpress-studio\` MCP server and bundled \`wordpress-telemetry\` MCP server.
- \`hooks/hooks.json\` adds lightweight session-start context using \`\${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT}\`.

## Marketplace layout

The parent \`plugins/factory/\` directory is a local Factory marketplace:

- \`.factory-plugin/marketplace.json\` lists the \`wordpress-studio\` plugin.
- \`plugins/wordpress-studio/\` contains this plugin.

## Local install

From this repository root after running \`pnpm build\`:

\`\`\`bash
droid plugin marketplace add ./plugins/factory
droid plugin install wordpress-studio@wordpress-studio --scope project
\`\`\`

Factory's plugin documentation also supports adding marketplaces from GitHub repositories. If this output is published from a dedicated marketplace repository, add that repository URL with \`droid plugin marketplace add <url>\` and install \`wordpress-studio@wordpress-studio\`.

\`mcp.json\` launches:

- \`wordpress-studio\`: runs \`studio mcp\` for WordPress site management, screenshots, block validation, performance tooling, and WP-CLI access.
- \`wordpress-telemetry\`: runs the bundled telemetry MCP server generated by this package.

No secrets are stored in the project MCP config.

function buildDevinAgentsMd() {
  return `# WordPress.com Devin Instructions

Use this output as a Devin CLI project configuration for WordPress.com work.

## Workflow

- Start with the \`wordpress-creator\` skill for WordPress.com build, theme, block, plugin, site-creation, or audit requests.
- Prefer the WordPress Studio MCP server for site discovery, local site control, screenshots, block validation, frontend audits, and \`wp_cli\` access.
- Use the bundled \`wordpress-telemetry\` MCP server for workflow telemetry when available.
- Choose the smallest fitting WordPress abstraction: site settings, content, theme, block, plugin, or audit.
- Keep WordPress.com as the user-facing product name.

## Devin-Specific Setup

- Devin CLI loads project rules from \`AGENTS.md\`.
- Devin CLI loads project skills from \`.devin/skills/<name>/SKILL.md\`.
- Devin CLI loads shared project MCP servers from \`.devin/config.json\`.
- This output uses Devin-native project configuration around the shared WordPress.com MCP and skill substrate; it does not introduce a Devin-specific backend service.

This Devin output packages the shared Build with WordPress skills for Devin CLI using Devin-native project configuration.

## Official Devin surfaces used

- Project rules: \`AGENTS.md\`
- Project config: \`.devin/config.json\`
- Project skills: \`.devin/skills/<name>/SKILL.md\`
- MCP servers: \`mcpServers\` in Devin config

- MCP configuration: https://docs.devin.ai/cli/extensibility/mcp/configuration.md
- Configuration files: https://docs.devin.ai/cli/extensibility/configuration.md

## Setup

1. Install Devin CLI using the official Devin CLI instructions.
2. Install WordPress Studio and make sure the \`studio\` CLI is available on your \`PATH\`.
3. Open this directory as the project root, or copy \`AGENTS.md\` and \`.devin/\` into the root of the project where Devin should assist with WordPress.com work.
4. Start Devin CLI from the configured project root.
5. Confirm the configured MCP servers are available in Devin CLI.

## MCP servers

\`.devin/config.json\` launches:

- \`wordpress-studio\`: runs \`studio mcp\` for WordPress site management, screenshots, block validation, performance tooling, and WP-CLI access.
- \`wordpress-telemetry\`: runs an embedded bootstrap generated from the shared telemetry server artifact.

This does not invent a Devin-only backend. Devin connects to the existing WordPress.com / Jetpack MCP flow through the same local Studio MCP entry point used by the other outputs.

- Plugin docs: https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/plugins
- Agent Skills standard and hub: https://agentskills.io

Hermes supports both skills and Git-distributed plugins, so this output includes both:

- \`skills/\` as a Skills Hub-compatible GitHub tap layout
- \`plugin.yaml\` and \`__init__.py\` for \`hermes plugins install user/repo\` style distribution
- \`.hermes/config.yaml\` as a copyable MCP server snippet for the WordPress Studio and telemetry MCP servers

## Included skills

${skillList}

## Installing as a skill tap

Publish this directory from a repository with \`skills/\` at its root, then install individual skills with Hermes' GitHub tap flow:

\`\`\`bash
hermes skills tap add owner/repo
hermes skills install owner/repo/wordpress-creator
\`\`\`

## Installing as a Hermes plugin

Hermes can install Git-hosted plugins with:

\`\`\`bash
hermes plugins install owner/repo
hermes plugins enable wordpress-studio
\`\`\`

The generated plugin registers each bundled skill with Hermes through \`ctx.register_skill()\`.

## MCP setup

Copy the \`.hermes/config.yaml\` MCP server snippet into the target Hermes profile config, then restart Hermes. The config launches the existing WordPress Studio MCP server plus the bundled \`wordpress-telemetry\` MCP server. This package does not introduce a new WordPress backend service.

- The generated \`plugins/cursor/\` folder uses Cursor's single-plugin layout
- Cursor discovers plugin skills from \`skills/\`
- Cursor discovers persistent guidance from \`rules/\`
- Cursor discovers MCP servers from root \`mcp.json\`
- WordPress request routing stays shared across surfaces
- Studio-backed site, theme, block, plugin, and audit workflows stay shared

## Local Cursor install and test flow

Build the generated package first:

\`\`\`bash
pnpm build
\`\`\`

Install it into Cursor's local native plugin directory:

\`\`\`bash
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/plugins/local
rm -rf ~/.cursor/plugins/local/wordpress-studio
cp -R plugins/cursor ~/.cursor/plugins/local/wordpress-studio
\`\`\`

For faster iteration from a source checkout, use a symlink instead of copying:

\`\`\`bash
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/plugins/local
rm -rf ~/.cursor/plugins/local/wordpress-studio
ln -s "$PWD/plugins/cursor" ~/.cursor/plugins/local/wordpress-studio
\`\`\`

Reload Cursor after installing or updating the local plugin. The local plugin root should contain these files:

- \`.cursor-plugin/plugin.json\`
- \`README.md\`
- \`mcp.json\`
- \`rules/wordpress-studio.mdc\`
- \`skills/<skill>/SKILL.md\` for each bundled skill

## MCP visibility checks

In Cursor's MCP or tools settings, confirm both plugin-provided servers are visible and enabled:

- \`wordpress-studio\`, which launches \`studio mcp\`
- \`wordpress-telemetry\`, which launches the bundled telemetry bootstrap from \`mcp.json\`

If the servers are missing, inspect \`~/.cursor/plugins/local/wordpress-studio/mcp.json\`, confirm \`studio --version\` works in a normal shell, then reload Cursor.

## Rules and skills visibility checks

Confirm Cursor loads the plugin guidance before doing Marketplace or standalone-repo work:

- The always-on rule from \`rules/wordpress-studio.mdc\` is available in Cursor's rules view or applies to WordPress requests.
- The bundled skills are visible from the local plugin, including \`wordpress-creator\`, \`site-creator\`, \`theme-creator\`, \`block-creator\`, \`plugin-creator\`, \`design-previews-creator\`, \`auditing\`, and \`studio\`.
- A WordPress site, theme, block, plugin, or audit request routes through the shared WordPress creator guidance and prefers Studio MCP tools before shell fallbacks.

## Standalone export and listing

Build with WordPress is the source of truth for this generated package. The standalone Cursor plugin repository is https://github.com/Automattic/wordpress-cursor-plugin and should be updated through the repository export script, not by manually editing exported files.

From the source repository, verify the generated output first:

\`\`\`bash
pnpm build
pnpm verify
pnpm export:cursor -- --dry-run
\`\`\`

When maintainers are ready to update the standalone repository, run \`pnpm export:cursor\` from a clean source worktree. The exporter creates a subtree split of \`plugins/cursor/\` and pushes it to \`sync/from-build-with-wordpress\` in the standalone repository. Do not manually edit generated Cursor output in the standalone repository; fix the generator or shared skills here, rebuild, verify, and export.

## Marketplace checklist

Before submitting or updating the Cursor listing:

- Confirm the exported standalone branch contains the expected \`.cursor-plugin/plugin.json\`, \`README.md\`, \`mcp.json\`, \`rules/wordpress-studio.mdc\`, and full \`skills/\` tree.
- Review the listing-facing manifest fields for name, display name, version, description, author, homepage, repository, license, keywords, rules, skills, and MCP server paths.
- Install the standalone branch locally at \`~/.cursor/plugins/local/wordpress-studio\` and repeat the MCP, rules, and skills visibility checks above.
- Open or update the standalone repository pull request from \`sync/from-build-with-wordpress\` into \`main\` and wait for review.
- Submit to Cursor Marketplace only after the standalone repository PR is accepted and the local native-plugin test flow passes.`,
